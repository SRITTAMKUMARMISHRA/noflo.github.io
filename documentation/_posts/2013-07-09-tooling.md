NoFlo itself is just a library for implementing flow-based programs in JavaScript. There is an ecosystem of tools around NoFlo and the [fbp protocol](https://flowbased.github.io/fbp-protocol/) that make it more powerful. Here are some of them:

* [Flowhub](https://flowhub.io) -- browser-based visual programming **IDE** for NoFlo and other flow-based systems
* [noflo-nodejs](https://github.com/noflo/noflo-nodejs) -- command-line interface for **running NoFlo programs on Node.js**
* [MsgFlo](https://msgflo.org) -- for running NoFlo and other FBP runtimes as a **distributed system**. NoFlo support via [noflo-runtime-msgflo](https://github.com/noflo/noflo-runtime-msgflo)
* [fbp-diff](https://github.com/flowbased/fbp-diff) -- Tool for **visualizing changes** between versions of a NoFlo graph
* [fbp-spec](https://github.com/flowbased/fbp-spec) -- **data-driven tests** for NoFlo and other FBP environments
* [flowtrace](https://github.com/flowbased/flowtrace) -- tool for **retroactive debugging** of NoFlo programs. Supports visual replay with Flowhub
