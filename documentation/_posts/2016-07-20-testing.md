## Testing with fbp-spec

Please refer to the [fbp-spec usage guide](https://github.com/flowbased/fbp-spec#usage).

## Testing with Mocha

In addition to testing tools tailored for flow-based program testing, you can of course test NoFlo components or graphs with regular JavaScript testing frameworks like [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/).

The easiest way to run a NoFlo component in Mocha is to use [NoFlo's `asCallback` method](/documentation/embedding) which wraps a component or graph into a simple callback function.

Here is an example:

```javascript
const noflo = require('noflo');
let baseDir = 'my-project';
if (!noflo.isBrowser()) {
  // Tests are running on Node.js, load chai and set project baseDir to project root
  const chai = require('chai');
  const path = require('path');
  baseDir = path.resolve(__dirname, '../');
}

describe('My component', () => {
  // Wrap your component into a function
  let mycomp = null;
  before(() => {
    // We need to provide the name of the component/graph we're
    // testing, and the project basedir where NoFlo looks for
    // components
    mycomp = noflo.asCallback('my_project/MyComponent', {
      baseDir: baseDir,
    });
  });
  // Then run it inside your tests
  it('should add one to the data it receives', (done) => {
    mycomp(1, (err, result) => {
      // If there was an error, fail the test
      if (err) { return done(err); }
      // Test the result
      chai.expect(result).to.equal(2);
      done()
    });
  });
});
```
